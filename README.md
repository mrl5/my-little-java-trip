# my-little-java-trip
Inspired by sensei Mitoridafi @LIttleAncientForestKami I am going to share some of my "ceramics" during my "practice funicular" travel.

1. Folder "main" contains some of http://www.lafk.pl/QA_Auto_Funicular/#_50_programs_in_a_week
2. Folder "fork" contains modified exercises from "main". They are modified because it was fun to do so.
